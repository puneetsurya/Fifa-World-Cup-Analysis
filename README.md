# Fifa-World-Cup-Analysis


Problem Statement:
With FIFA is in the blood of many people of the world. You are tasked to tell the story of unsung
analysts who put great efforts to provide accurate data to answer every question of fans. The
FIFA World Cup is a global football competition contested by the various football-playing
nations of the world. It is contested every four years and is the most prestigious and important
trophy in the sport of football.

The World Cups dataset shows all information about all the World Cups in history, while the
World Cup Matches dataset shows all the results from the matches contested as part of the
cups. Find key metrics and factors that influence the World Cup win. Do your own research
and come up with your findings.

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, where I dove deep into the FIFA World Cup data, bringing fans a detailed look into key metrics and trends from this historic tournament! This dashboard showcases valuable insights such as total matches played, winning stats, top scoring teams, attendance trends, and much more. Huge thanks to Unified Mentor for the opportunity and guidance on this project!

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how I achieved this:

Steps Taken:

Data Loading & Cleaning: Loaded 3 datasets into Power BI - WorldCupMatches, WorldCupPlayers, and WorldCups. Cleaned and structured the data to align field formats.

Data Modeling: Created necessary relationships between tables using composite keys, managing one-to-many relationships, and joining on fields like MatchID and Year.
Calculated Columns & Measures: Designed custom measures to capture insights like winning percentages, total goals, and attendance averages.

Visualizations: Developed visuals including bar charts for World Cup wins, line charts for attendance trends, and pie charts for match outcomes. Used slicers for dynamic filtering by year, team initials, and stage.
Dashboard Design: Presented KPIs in an engaging layout to provide a quick snapshot and deep dive into each metric.

Here are some key insights drawn from your FIFA World Cup Analysis dashboard:

1. Top World Cup Winners:
Brazil leads with 5 World Cup wins, followed by Italy and Germany with 4 each. These teams have consistently performed at a high level across tournaments, making them dominant forces in World Cup history.
2. Match Outcomes:
Home Team Advantage: Home teams won 57% of the time, highlighting a significant advantage when playing on familiar ground.
Away Wins and Draws: Away teams only won around 20.45% of the time, and draws accounted for 22.2% of outcomes, showing that home ground influence can be a key factor in match results.
3. Top Scoring Teams:
Brazil, Argentina, and Germany are the top scorers, with Brazil leading at 221 goals. This emphasizes the offensive strength of these teams over multiple tournaments.
4. Attendance Trends:
Attendance has generally increased over time, with spikes observed around the 1994 and 2014 tournaments, where average attendance hit 69K and 53K respectively. These peaks reflect heightened global interest during these years.
5. Goal Trends Over the Years:
An upward trend in goals scored per tournament is seen over the years, with notable peaks in tournaments like 1954 and 2014. This could be due to evolving play styles, rule changes, or improved team strategies over time.
6. Top Home-Dominating Teams:
Teams like Argentina and Brazil boast a high winning percentage when playing at home, with Argentina having a 75% win rate. This insight could indicate psychological or environmental advantages when these teams play in their home countries.
7. High-Attendance Stadiums:
Stadiums in Brazil, such as Arena de Sao Paulo and Arena Fonte Nova, recorded high average attendances, especially during the 2014 World Cup. This showcases the enthusiasm of local fans and the popularity of football in Brazil.
These insights provide a holistic view of performance trends, attendance, and influential factors that impact match outcomes and team successes in the FIFA World Cup. This analysis can aid in understanding historical patterns and even predicting trends for future tournaments.
